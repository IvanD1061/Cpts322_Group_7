# Sprint 1 Report: Team 7 (5/6-5/31, 2024)
## Whats new
Since we started from scratch at the start of this project, our team devoted the start of the sprint to learning our tech stack. Since the frontend was our first priority, we began
by learning HTML, CSS, and Angular as well as the basics of javascript and node. We then began implimenting the frontend and so far have an angular project with a login page
as well as HTML and CSS files for a home page that need to me merged into the main angular project. 
## Work Summary
Since we were learning everything for the first time, we began by learning web design basics such as html and css. Then we build a basic design. After that, we took our
existing HTML and intigrated it into angular. This was a challenging step because none of us knew how to use it, but eventually we were able to get it working. 
Our plan is to get roughly 10% of the project done in sprint one, 80% in sprint 2, and 10% in sprint 3. I would estimate we did slightly less than 10% of the project, but
because we spend so much time teaching ourselves and reading documentation, it will make our future work go much quicker.
## Unfinished Work
We still need to add a home page to the angular project. The HTML and CSS files are complete, so it should only take 20-30 minutes to do. Once that is done, we need to add
functionality for keeping track of frontend data and variables, which we plan to impliment this weekend.
